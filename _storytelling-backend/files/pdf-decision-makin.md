### Entrepreneurial decision-making (case seminar) 

_“Entrepreneurial decision-making is about understanding how and why individuals make decisions pertaining to entrepreneurial action. Much of the current work has been conducted from an entrepreneurial cognition approach aiming to uncover how entrepreneurs think and act upon certain logic. Entrepreneurial cognition can be understood as "the knowledge structures" entrepreneurs use to make assessments, judgments or decisions under uncertainty. At this seminar, we will discuss entrepreneurial decision-making based on the case "Using Effectuation to start up a new venture through Instagram”._ **Sara Sarasvathy (2001):** Managerial vs. entrepreneurial thinking Causation VS Effectuation 

##### Principles of effectuation Sarasvathy, S.D. 2022 

- _Bird in hand_ - imagine possibilities, leverage your means 

- _Affordable loss_ - focus on downside risk 

- _Lemonade_ – leverage contingencies/ opportunities arising from the unexpected 

- _Crazy quilt_ - form self-selected partnerships to co-create the outcome 

- _Pilot in the plane_ - control rather than predict the future, focus on actions where you can influence the     outcome 


### 2. Entrepreneurial learning 

_“Join us for an engaging lecture on entrepreneurial learning, where we will explore the process that propels individuals, teams, and ventures towards success. We will delve into the dynamic process by which entrepreneurs learn and how their learning transcends multiple levels, shaping the entrepreneurial mindset, fostering collaborative teamwork, and driving venture growth. During this session, we will explore the individual level of learning, detailing how entrepreneurs develop knowledge through self-reflection. However, entrepreneurship is not a solo adventure; it thrives on collaboration and teamwork. Therefore, we will explore the team level of entrepreneurial learning and discuss how collective knowledge emerges through effective communication and collaboration. Finally, we will explore learning at the venture level, unveiling how ventures develop through real-world experiences, learn from failures and successes, and refine their routines based on market feedback”._ At an early stage, failure can occur due to... → Cycling → Why call it a failure, instead call it Cycling, which is more positive. Cycling is associated with entrepreneurial learning. Investors Failure is one of the entrepreneur's most important and valuable assets and investors know it. They prefer to work with entrepreneurs who have a series of glorious failures behind them than with entrepreneurs who are building their first startup, still thinking that they are bulletproof. Attitudes towards cycling → Different forms of cycling 


 Effects of business cycling ( micro level) 

- Financial, relational, and emotional costs (Cope; 2011; Ucbasaran et al, 2013; Shepherd, 2003) 

- Learning opportunity - expands the search for new opportunities, reduce uncertainty, and provides     signals of cause-effect relationship (Sitkin, 1992; McGrath,1999) Effects of business cycling ( **macro** level) A catalyst for further economic and business development. The termination of non-competitive ventures     essential to wealth creation → releases unproductive use of knowledge/resources that can be     reallocated to more viable venture opportunities (Hoetker & Agarwal, 2007). The role of cycling in entrepreneurial learning 

- Many successful entrepreneurs credit their learning from past cycling as a crucial aspect of their     learning. 

- Cycling is an essential prerequisite for entrepreneurial learning as it provides an opportunity to pinpoint     why a failure has occurred (e.g., change of organisational routines) 

- Stimulates entrepreneurs to pursue an explorative search for new possibilities where learning through     experimentation becomes a central learning technique 

- A cycling analysis can serve as a powerful mechanism to resolve uncertainty, increase variety and     expand the search for solutions Attitudes towards cycling! 

- Attitudes toward cycling are not homogenous among entrepreneurs, but learned and shaped through     entrepreneurs’ life and work, and thus influenced by prior experience (Politis & Gabrielsson, 2009) 

- A higher cycling acceptance stimulates an explorative search for new possibilities learning through     experimentation becomes a central learning technique. Attitudes towards cycling depend on key cognitive variables (El-Awad, 2023) 

- PRIOR EXPERIENCE 

- SENSEMAKING PROCESSES 

- PERCEPTION OF UNCERTAINTY Entrepreneurial learning (Politis,2005) What is entrepreneurial learning? 

- The process through which entrepreneurs develop knowledge to facilitate the discovery, evaluation, and     exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (Minniti & Bygrave, 2001; Politis, 2005; Corbett, 2007) 

- A process that connects the individual and organizational levels of learning (El-Awad, 2019) 

- A dynamic process through which entrepreneurs learn in their social setting and leverage knowledge     assets internally and external to their venture (EL—Awad, 2023) Levels of learning 

1. **Micro** level → Learning as a personal development and growth (e.g., life-long learning). Change in     how I think and reason. 

2. **Meso** level → Learning as a condition for long-term survival and growth in organisations (e.g.,     organisational learning and change of routines) 


3. **Macro** level → Learning as a condition for societal development and economic growth (e.g.,     innovation systems) Implications on my customers/suppliers 

### Micro → Individual-level entrepreneurial learning 

Various ways to look at EL at the individual level. Depends on the stage you are in! 

- Learning to recognize and act on opportunities, and interacting socially to initiate, organize and manage     ventures (Rae, 2005) 

- A process that facilitates the development of necessary knowledge for being effective in starting up and     managing new ventures (Politis, 2005) 

- Entrepreneurial learning is a dynamic process through which entrepreneurs learn in their social setting     and leverage knowledge assets internal and external to their venture (El-Awad, 2023) Individual-level learning outcome 

- _Attitudes and values_ 

- Identity: (who am I?), Shared social groups (what do I share with others?) 

- Intentions and behaviours: learning involves change, e.g. how did I change my behaviours? 

- Knowledge and skills (what did I learn from my experience? Entrepreneurship is shaped by Personality, Context and Life experience (El-Awad et al., 2022) 

- Entrepreneurs may have certain personalities and traits that they are born with, but they are also shaped     by their history and experience in life 

- The social environment they find themselves in (e.g., growing up with entrepreneurial parents,     entrepreneurial ecosystem) 

- Personal experiences, such as education and work     experience (Politis, 2005) Entrepreneurship as an experiential learning process “A process whereby knowledge is created through grasping and transforming experience” Learning involves: 

- Grasping (acquiring experience) 

- Transforming (developing knowledge) Types of experiences 

- **Start-up experience:** Helps with opportunity     recognition, ability to see new means-ends     relationships, windows of opportunity 

- **Management experience** : Training in negotiation,     problem-solving, managing people 

- **Industry experience:** Understanding customers and     markets, relationships between supply and demand, the value of goods and services Social learning Learning is a process of social interaction or co-participation and is dependent on social, historical and cultural factors. Occurs through close contact with other people, observation and imitation of role model behaviours (vicarious). 


### Meso → Organisational-level learning 

How do organisations learn? Individuals are socialized to organizational beliefs → Organisations store knowledge in their procedures, norms, rules and forms (by accumulating knowledge over time from their members), while individuals are socialized to organizational beliefs. Organizational Learning as a multilevel process (El-Awad, 2019; Crossan Et al., 1999) _Intuiting stage:_ Members of the organization realize specific patterns or possibilities through their experiences (externalizing distinctions) _Interpreting stage:_ Individuals verbalize their observed patterns, and, in doing so, share their intuitions with other members of the organization. (Rotating task work) _Integrating stage:_ A collective process whereby group members develop a shared understanding of new ideas and how to put them into action. (Co-constructing tasks, uncovering perspectives, and agreeing through mutual adjustment) _Institutionalization stage:_ A process of embedding learning that has occurred at the individual and group levels into the organization. (Routinizing behaviours through coding and sharing practices and drawing analogies 

### Macro →Societal development and economic growth (e.g... innovation systems) 

 The regional innovation systems are integrated by actors (explorers, exploiters, and intermediaries or catalyzers) who interact among themselves, and whose relational proximity is key to economic development. Antecedents of Macro-level learning The ability to use resources: in order to perform a task or activity Core skills : important element that influences interactive learning “What can you offer” The institutional infrastructure : that supports innovation is the productive structure of a region” Interactions among agents in the RIS

### Entrepreneurial decision-making 

 Gabrielsson, J., & Politis, D., (2011) Career motives and entrepreneurial decision-making: examining preferences for causal and effectual logics in the early stage of new ventures. Small Business Economics, 36(3): 281-298. 

##### How entrepreneurs' career motives influence their decision-making processes, particularly in the context of the 

##### decision-making logics: causation and effectuation. 

**2 modes of decision-making logics (Sarasvathy, 2001)** _Causation:_ 

- This logic focuses on determining what actions should be taken based on predetermined goals and available means. 

- Focuses on analyzing and estimating existing and latent markets, relying on predictability. _Effectuation:_ 

- This logic emphasizes determining what can be done based on available means and envisioned outcomes. 

- Emphasizes synthesis and imagination to create new markets, based on the logic of control. _→ Both logics can coexist in decision-making._ Influence of Career Motives 

- The career concept model differentiates between four basic careers: 

- **Linear** (power & achievement) - consists of a progressive series of steps upward in a hierarchy 

- **Expert (** technical expertise)- defined by the lifelong commitment to an occupation to master the skills, knowledge, and     work of the expert’s choice. 

- **Spiral** (personal growth and creativity) - person occasionally makes periodic major moves across occupational areas,     specialties, or disciplines. 

- **Transitory** (variety and independence) - consistent inconsistency, where a person moves from one field or job to a very     different or unrelated field or job. → Linear or expert career motives = preference for **causal** decision-making logic. → Spiral or transitory career motives = preference for **effectual** decision-making logic. 

- There is an indication that prior start-up experience moderates the relationship between career motives and the preference for     effectual decision-making logic, particularly for entrepreneurs with spiral-minded career motives. 


Sarasvathy, S. (2001) Casuation and effectuation: Toward a theoretical shift from economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency, A _cademy of Management Review_ , 26(2), 243-263. Identification and development of a decision model that involves processes of effectuation, rather than causation, and shoeing its use in the creation of new firmes. **Causation definition:** Causation processes take a particular effact as givem and focus on selecting between means to create that effect. (Use the food meny and than go and shop the ingredients) **Effectuation definition:** Effectuation processes take a set of means as given and focus on selecting between possible effects that can be created with that set of means. (Looks through the cupboards and than decide which meal to cook). _Choosing between means to create a particular effect, versus choosing between many possible effects using a particular set of means._ → these two ways of reasoning can occur SIMULTANEOUSLY! It is important to understand that one is not better than the other, it depends on the means available! 

##### A rudimentary theory of effactuation processes in business: (kind of hard to summarize) 

Entrepreneurs starts out with three resources: _Individual level:_ (1) who they are, (2) what they know, and (3) whom they know. _Company level:_ (1) physical resources, (2) human resources, and (3) organizational resources. _Economic level:_ (1) demographics, (2) current technology regimes and (3) socio-political institutions. → Effectuation might be more common in human decision-making, as human life often involves unexpected events and limited resources (dealing with uncertainty). Risk VS Uncertainty Risk: outcomes are known Uncertainty: outcomes are unknown → decision-makers often prefer known probabilities!!! **4 key principles of effectuation** 

1. Prioritize acceptable loss over expected return     a. Effectuators focus on determining an acceptable level of potential loss rather than aiming for maximum expected gains.        This principle encourages cautious decision-making. 

2. Emphasis strategic alliances over competitive analysis     a. Instead of viewing others as competitors, effectuators seek strategic alliances and collaborations with stakeholders to        reduce uncertainty and share resources. 

3. Leverage unforeseen events over existing knowledge     a. Effectuators remain open to adapting and leveraging unexpected opportunities that may arise during the course of 


 action. They prioritize flexibility and responsiveness. 

4. Focus on controlling an unpredictable future rather than predicting an uncertain one     a. Effectuation emphasizes influencing and shaping the future through proactive actions, as opposed to trying to predict an        inherently uncertain future. It is important to consider effectuation as an alternative decision making model! _These agree:_ James G.March 

- March's focus on decision-making based on unknown future values. 

- Causal and effectual reasoning can complement each other in decision-making processes. 

- **March's** Ideas: March's concepts of exploration and challenging existing goals are discussed. Henry Mintzberg 

- Mintzberg's critique of traditional strategic planning. 

- Example of Honda's success through unconventional ideas. 

- Mintzberg argues that strategic planning is not equivalent to strategy formation, and evidence suggests a different model of     decision-making is needed, emphasizing synthesis and action. 

- Suggestion that effectuation could offer an alternative to strategy formation. 

- **Mintzberg's** Perspective: Mintzberg's emphasis on evidence collection over planning and prediction is highlighted. Karl E.Weick 

- Weick's theory centers on decision-makers in organizations. 

- Weick's quote, "Learning 1, Planning 0," refers to the idea that learning from experience surpasses traditional planning. 

- Non-linear nature of decision-making in organizations. 

- Emphasis on capturing dynamic, emergent decision-making. 

- **Weick's** Contribution: Weick's focus on enactment and forward living is introduced. **Future theoretical work on effectuation** → these concepts are synthesized into a model of effective reasoning: _Key components of the model_ 

- Control Logic: Emphasizes control over prediction. 

- Endogenous Goal Formation: Goals are formed from within the decision-making process. 

- Partially Constructed Environment: Recognizes the influence of the environment. 


**Propositions for the role of effectuation processes in businesses** (the role of effectuation processes in companies, industries and economies, highlighting the difference between effectuation and traditional decision-making). These are only hypotheses!!!! ● At the level of the **economy** : ○ Effectuation is proposed as a valuable approach for stimulating entrepreneurial activity. It suggests that companies created through effectuation processes are more likely to fail early and at lower investment levels, allowing for experimentation with new ideas at lower costs. ● At the level of the **market or industry:** ○ The text emphasizes the importance of effectuation in creating new markets and industries, as it enables entrepreneurs to harness unforeseen social and technical events. It proposes that successful early participants in a new industry are more likely to use effectuation processes. ● At the level of the **firm** : ○ Effectuation is suggested as a valuable approach for early-stage companies, focusing on forming alliances and partnerships rather than traditional competitive strategies. It also highlights the potential for effectuators to handle failures effectively and build more successful companies in the long run. ● Within the firm At the level of founders/decision makers (these are just hypotheses, and Sarasvathy says that they need to be tested!) ■ Conjecture 1: In marketing decisions, effectuators are less likely to use traditional market research and more likely to dive directly into marketing and sales activities and alliances. ■ Conjecture 2: In financial decisions, effectuators are less likely to use long-term planning or net present value analysis (NPV) and more likely to focus on the short term and informal versions of real options. ■ Conjecture 3: In organizational decisions, effectuators are more likely to build participatory cultures rather than hierarchical ones and may be less effective at managing large organizations. ■ Conjecture 4: Effectuators are more likely to fail but may manage failures more effectively and create larger, more successful companies in the long run. 

### Entrepreneurial learning 

 Politis, D. (2005) The process of entrepreneurial learning: A conceptual framework. Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice , 29(4), 399-424. 

##### A conceptual framework for understanding the process of entrepreneurial learning. 

This article focuses on explaining how entrepreneurs learn from experiences and develop expertise. The framework identifies 3 key components: 

1. entrepreneurs’ career experience 

2. the transformation process 

3. entrepreneurial knowledge So what can we understand from the article? 

- Entrepreneurs who have prior start-up experience tend to be more successful in subsequent ventures. 

- Much of entrepreneurial learning is experiential, with past experiences playing a significant role, entrepreneurial learning is a     continuous, experiential process. . **Entrepreneurial experience VS Entrepreneurial knowledge** 

- Entrepreneurial experience → a direct observation/participation in new venture creation events 

- Entrepreneurial knowledge → the knowledge that the person has derived from the particular experience ....Can be compared to Kolb’s (1984) two basic dimensions of experimental learning 

1. Acquisition (grasping) → “experience” 

2. Transformation → “experimentally acquired knowledge” So now that we know the difference, we shall investigate the experimental process where the personal experience of the entrepreneurs is 


continuously transformed into knowledge. We shall use this framework to understand the study → **Entrepreneurial knowledge** (upper-right in the figure) _What will the learning lead to?_ 

_1. Increased effectiveness in opportunity recognition_     a. have value knowledge: contacts, suppliers,        viable markets, product availability,        competitive resources + response     b. more likely to pursue ventures as a means of        gaining access to a wider range of “shadow        options”     c. entrepreneurial mindset: seeking and        pursuing only the best opportunities     d. or... relevant information + cognitive        properties = opportunity recognition 

_2. Increased effectiveness in coping with the liabilities of_     _newness_ 

- High morality in first years → financial and     marketing problems 

- BUT previous experience (business skills,     well-developed networks, business reputation     OR production technology and managerial     capability) can counteract this!! AKA wealth, power & legitimacy. **Entrepreneurs career experiences and entrepreneurial knowledge** (A: upper-left in the figure) _What is the learning/experience?_ **Proposition 1** : The entrepreneur's career experience, in terms of start-up, management and industry-specific experience, is positively related to the development of entrepreneurial knowledge, a. The more career experience, the more effective the entrepreneur in recognising and acting on _entrepreneurial opportunities_ b. The more career experience, the more effective is the entrepreneur in coping with the _liabilities of the newness_ **Transformation process** (the square in the middle) _How does the experimental learning theory impact entrepreneurship? Experimental learning_ = “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” (Kolb, 1984) 

- Develop knowledge (four-stage learning cycle - Kolb): experiencing, reflecting, thinking and acting. The transformation process can take one of two courses: _Exploitation:_ entrepreneurs may choose actions that replicate or are closely related to the ones they have already taken, thereby exploiting their preexisting knowledge. _Exploration:_ Entrepreneurs can choose new actions that are distinct from the ones that they have already taken. **Proposition 2** : An entrepreneur's predominant mode of transformation moderates the relationship between his or her career and entrepreneurial knowledge. a. The more overall reliance on exploration as the predominant mode of transformation, the more effective is the entrepreneur in recognizing and acting on entrepreneurial opportunities. b. The more overall reliance on exploitation as the predominant mode of transformation, the more effective the entrepreneur in coping with the liability of newness. **Factors influencing the transformation process** (the square on the bottom) _What is impacting how a person transforms experiences into knowledge?_ 

1. The outcome of previous entrepreneurial events 


 a. Previous success tends to lead to exploiting existing knowledge, while failure may promote exploration and learning through experimentation. 

2. The predominant logic or reasoning of the entrepreneur     a. Entrepreneurs may use causation (predictable and efficient) or effectuation (adaptive and creative) logic. Causation        leans towards exploiting existing knowledge, while effectuation encourages exploring new possibilities. 

3. The Entrepreneurs' Career Orientation     a. Different career orientations (linear, expert, spiral, or transitory) can affect an entrepreneur's focus. Linear and expert        orientations prioritize expertise and exploitation, while spiral and transitory orientations favour exploration and        experimentation. → These factors shape how entrepreneurs turn their experiences into entrepreneurial knowledge, with some emphasizing exploitation and others leaning towards exploration. El-Awad, Z. (2023). Explore or exploit? Unpacking the situational conditions and cognitive mechanisms underlying entrepreneurial learning in the new venture development process. Entrepreneurship & Regional Development, 35(1-2), 162-186. Links to an external site. 

##### When and why do entrepreneurs choose entrepreneurial learning strategies that emphasize exploration and 

##### exploitation when developing their ventures? 

The study focuses on two approaches to learning: **_Exploration_** and **_Exploitation._** But how do entrepreneurs choose between them? Impact of previous experiences → Positive experiences reinforce (exploitation) past behaviors while negative experiences drive entrepreneurs to explore (exploration) new domains as a part of their coping strategies. Exploration → creativity and innovation Exploitation → efficiency and consistency (The study follows 4 research based spin-off companies (RBSO’s) an their development phases: (1) _R&D_ , (2) _framing_ , (3) _reconfiguration_ (4) and _organization_ .) **Conceptual background** ● Entrepreneurial leaning & venture development ○ Entrepreneurs... ■ ...accumulate knowledge through interactions and reflections in their social context. ■ ...face uncertainties (rapidly changing environments) and must make sense of the situations. ■ ...seek diverse knowledge & skills (often through social networks) ■ ...learn from others in venture developments through collaboration and contingent interactions ● Approaches to entrepreneurial learning (exploration & exploitation) ○ the learning involves exploration & exploitation (which differ in cognition & behaviours) ○ social settings shape how ENT’s process info & take action ■ exploitative learning = replicate prior experiences ■ explorative learning = seeks new possibilities ● Exploration and exploitation and the role of perceived uncertainty ○ Uncertainty (key factor in ENT-learning) ■ the perceived uncertainty impacts the ENT’s choice of exploration or exploitation ■ the type of uncertainty matters → firm-specific / market specific ■ different types of uncertainty = different learning behaviours ● Entrepreneurs awareness of learning choices ○ the ENT’s are not always aware of their learning process → therefore the study focuses on their actions rather than their awareness 


**3 fundamental mechanisms of learning** ● Action ○ practical experience ● Cognitive mechanisms _○ Collaborative Sensemaking (_ team discussions) _○ Shared perception of uncertainty (_ mutual understanding of sensemaking) _Actions + Cognitive mechanisms + Situational conditions = learning APPROACH_ **= learning APPROACHES** 

- Reactive/defensive (emphasizing exploitation) 

- Prospective (emphasizing exploration) 

- Analytical (balancing exploration and exploitation) **Key points of findings** 

- Entrepreneurial Enthusiasm: Entrepreneurs initially exhibit enthusiasm but underestimate uncertainties. 

- Relevance of Experience: The significance of prior experience determines learning and sensemaking. 

- Cautious vs. Confident: Entrepreneurs may become cautious or confident based on structural similarities between experiences. 

- External Learning: Entrepreneurs rely on external resources when they lack the necessary knowledge. 

- Unconventional Learning: Entrepreneurs sometimes employ defensive learning strategies despite perceived uncertainty. 

- Combining Exploration and Exploitation: As ventures progress, they may use both exploration and exploitation even in later     stages. 

- Changing Perceptions: Sensemaking and perception of uncertainty evolve over time, impacting learning strategies. 

- Diminishing Role of Prior Experience: The importance of prior experience diminishes as ventures mature, highlighting the value     of real-time learning.
